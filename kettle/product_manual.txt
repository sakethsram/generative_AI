To boil water using the kettle, follow these steps:
1. Open the lid and fill the kettle with fresh water, observing the maximum fill line to avoid overflow.
2. Securely place the kettle on its power base.
3. Plug the power cord into a wall outlet, ensuring the connection is firm and stable.
4. Switch the kettle on by pressing the power button or flipping the switch. The indicator light will illuminate, indicating that the kettle is heating.
5. Once the water reaches a boil, the kettle will automatically shut off, and the indicator light will turn off. Wait a moment before pouring to allow the kettle to cool slightly.

### 4.2 Cooking with the Kettle
The pigeon kettle can be utilized for more than just boiling water:
- Preparing Instant Noodles: Fill the kettle with the required amount of water and bring it to a boil. Once boiling, pour the water over the noodles in a bowl. Cover the bowl with a lid or plate to keep the heat in and let it sit for 3-5 minutes for the noodles to soften.
- Making Oatmeal: Similar to instant noodles, pour boiling water over oatmeal in a bowl and let it sit covered until cooked to your desired consistency.
- Steaming Vegetables: If your kettle has a steaming tray, you can place vegetables above the boiling water to steam them. This is a healthy cooking method that retains nutrients.

### 4.3 Tips for Optimal Use
- Always start with cold, fresh water for boiling to ensure the best taste and quality.
- If preparing beverages like tea or coffee, pre-warm your cup by rinsing it with hot water from the kettle.
- Use a thermometer if you’re brewing specialty teas; some teas require specific temperatures for optimal flavor.
- For convenience, consider boiling extra water to store in a thermos for later use.
